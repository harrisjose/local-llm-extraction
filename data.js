A couple of things have happened over the last year since I last came: A Michelin Bib Gourmand, 7th Best in MENA and she’s opened at Harrods too. Pheww. 🔥

Got the Spicy Duck Ramen, Koji Wings, Hammachi and a Hojicha to wash it all down. All of it was excellent. ♥️ 

Needs to be on everyone’s list for restaurants to try in Dubai.`,
